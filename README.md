### Data Science Basics

Here you'll find the hands-on implementation code and datasets accompanying the data science fundamentals I discuss in my [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@aussiekom). This repository serves as a practical companion to the theoretical concepts explored in my writings, offering you a real-world perspective on data science.

**How to Use:**

📖 *Medium Articles:* Visit [Medium](https://medium.com/@aussiekom) page to explore the theoretical foundations of data science concepts.

🖥️ *Code Implementation:* Find the corresponding code in this repository to apply what you've learned. Each folder is dedicated to a specific topic, making it easy to navigate.

📂 *Datasets:* Download datasets from the 'datasets' directory to replicate the analyses and experiments conducted in the code.

**Also you can check my Data Science Foundations mindmap for the overview of the main subjects and disciplines you need to know in data science. [link will be provided later]**

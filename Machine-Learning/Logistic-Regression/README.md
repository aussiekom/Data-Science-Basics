### Logistic Regression with scikit-learn library

One of the best things about the scikit-learn library in python is that *it provides four steps modeling patterns that make it easy for the programmer to train a machine learning classifier.* 

In the related notebook, we will use Logistic Regression with python, to classify the digits which are based on images. After preparing the machine learning model with this logistic regression, we can use it to predict an image labeled with the numbers.

**Scikit-learn 4 Steps Modelling Pattern(Logistic Regression):**

1. Import the model that we want to use. Here we use the logistic regression.
2. Create an instance of the model, which means that we need to store the Logistic Regression model into a variable.
3. Train the model. For this, we need the fit the data into our Logistic Regression model.
4. Predict the labels for the new data. Here we need to use the information that we learned while training the model.

### Logistic Regression with scikit-learn library

One of the best things about the scikit-learn library in python is that *it provides four steps modeling patterns that make it easy for the programmer to train a machine learning classifier.* 

In the related notebook, we will use Logistic Regression with python, to classify the digits which are based on images. After preparing the machine learning model with this logistic regression, we can use it to predict an image labeled with the numbers.

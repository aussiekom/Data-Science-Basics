### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm which **uses a dependent variable to predict future outcomes based on one or more independent variables.** It measures the association between two variables. Linear regression analysis is the most widely used of all machine learning algorithms.

Simply put, linear regression is a statistical test applied to a set of data to define and quantify the relationship between the variables considered. It is simple to use and is still considered among the most powerful algorithms.

**The use of the linear regression algorithm is important for the following reasons:**

* **Description:** It helps to analyze the strength of the association between the result (dependent variable) and the predictor variables.
* **Adjustment:** It adjusts the effect of covariates or confounders.
* **Predictors:** It helps to estimate the important risk factors that affect the dependent variable.
* **The extent of the prediction:** It helps analyze the magnitude of the change in the independent variable of a “unit” that would affect the dependent variable.
* **Prediction:** It helps quantify new cases.

### Decision Trees 

Decision Trees are versatile Machine Learning algorithms that **can perform both classification and regression tasks, and even multi-output tasks.** They are powerful algorithms, capable of fitting complex datasets.

Decision trees are also the fundamental components of Random Forests, which are among the most powerful Machine Learning algorithms available today.

In the notebook, there are a discussing how to train, visualize, and make predictions with Decision Trees, observe of teh CART training algorithm used by Scikit-Learn, and discussion how to regularize trees and use them for regression tasks.

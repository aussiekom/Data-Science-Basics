### Clustering in exploratory data analysis 


**Clustering Algorithms**

Given the usefulness of clustering in many different disciplines (genomics, marketing, etc.), a multitude of variants and adaptations of its methods and algorithms have been developed. 

Three main groups can be distinguished:

* **Partitioning Clustering:** this type of algorithm requires the user to specify in advance the number of clusters to be created (K-means, K-medoids, CLARA).
  
* **Hierarchical Clustering:** these types of algorithms do not require the user to specify in advance the number of clusters (agglomerative clustering, divisive clustering).

* **Methods that combine or modify the previous ones:** hierarchical K-means, fuzzy clustering, model based clustering and density based clustering.
